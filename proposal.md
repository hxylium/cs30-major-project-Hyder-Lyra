# Description
## F1 Racing | AI/Online Multiplayer

## Needs to have
### F1:
- Physics:
    - The car during high speed turns has to go off track and basically how do we measure something that has speed and mass to skid
        - Matter.js is my current thought of how to do this with
    - The car has to have a (Matter.js)
        - speed
        - mass
        - direction
        - position
        - velocity
        - force

- Levels:
    - AI Levels (1, 2, 3...) (Single Player)
    - Online Multiplayer Level (Rooms)  

- Resize:
    - Rescaling the screen aproprietly so that the graphics look okay

- Graphics:
    - Graphics should look good and should have different tracks, real F1 tracks (Spa, Bahrain...)
    - Sand and road should ave different densities and affect how th ecar drive and feels on each patch
    - Top down view should follow the car on the track

- Sounds:
    - Car sounds
    - Track sounds
    - Music

## Nice to have

- Split Screen
- Multiple views for the user
- User costomization:
    - The user gets to customize his avatar for the game
    - The user gets to customize his car for the game
