# Major Project Reflection

## What advice would I give myself?
- ask for advice earlier on in the process so time is not spent on a dead end/harder path
- Don't try to make fancy curves, just make bends using a single flat wall on an angle
- 

## Was everything in needs to have completed?
- On my end I was not able to create an AI for cars, but other then that I got everything I needed to do

## The hardest part?
- realizing we wouldn't have the time to properly implement multiplayer
- having to stop working on this project to do work on other things that needed doing

## Were there any problems I could not solve?
- We weren't able to implement the multiplayer as we had initially intended
