# Hyder's Reflection for the Major Project
## What Advice would I give myself?
- Read through the documentation fully before attempting to start testing code.
- Play safe and don't go too overbound with your own capabilites and time restraints.
- Don't take too much risks.

## Was everything in needs to have completed?
- Unfortunatly not, our levels idea was a major flop, and I could not deliver on anything due to various reasons.

## The hardest part?
- Trying to understand how web server communication works was a major hasstle and this is where I should have realised that doing multiplayer would have been near impossible with the time restraints.

## What did you achieve and learned?
- A great and working physics enabled racing game with multiple players.
- I learned how to use websickets to some extent which really interested me and I now know how to make some basic 2 player games is I wanted to such as Tic-Tac-Toe.
- I learned a lot about how networking works and how the internet interacts and works so seemlessly and how advanced this technology has become.
- I learned that servers aren't a web-application, though they can be like Heroku but just pure code, which amazed me.
