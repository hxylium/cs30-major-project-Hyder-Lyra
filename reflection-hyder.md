# Hyder's Reflection for the Major Project
## What Advice would I give myself?
- Read through the documentation fully before attempting to start testing code.
- Play safe and don't go too overbound with your own capabilites and time restraints.
- Don't take too much risks.

## Was everything in needs to have completed?
- Unfortunatly not, our levels idea was a major flop, and I could not deliver on anything due to various reasons.

## The hardest part?
- Trying to understand how web server communication works was a major hassle and this is where I should have realised that doing multiplayer would have been near impossible with the time restraints.

## Were there any problems I could not solve?
-
